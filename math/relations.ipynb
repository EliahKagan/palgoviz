    "- One mistake that is easy to make is to also erroneously flip the operands, thus wrongly writing `not (y > x)`. If it is desired to put the operands in the other order as well, then the easiest way to get it right is to first write `not (x > y)`, and then turn that into `not (y < x)`.\n",

    "- When you have a weak ordering that is not (known to be) a total ordering, this transformation effectively changes the meaning from expressing \"less than or equal to\" to expressing \"less than or similar to.\" But that transformation is often desired!"
