    "## Why define non-total weak orderings?\n",
    "\n",
    "`sorted` (and `list.sort`) suports an optional keyword-only argument `key=` for passing a custom key-selector function. The keys this function returns must themselves obey weak ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we know any objects that may appear in some iterable, `items`, are comparable, and that this comparison obeys weak ordering. Then `sorted(items)` is a sorted list of the objects in `items`. But since weak orderings induce a total ordering on their equivalence classes (under the $\\sim$ relation, as defined above), in principle there is always a totally ordered key selector function that could have been used instead, even if the objects didn't support being compared with `<`. This hypothetical (though often quite practical) key selector would be one that, when passed an object $x$, selects a key that behaves, under order comparisons, like the equivalence class containing $x$ under the induced comparison of equivalence classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above&mdash;and given that non-total weak orderings can be nonintuitive&mdash;the question arises of when, if ever, we should design a type so that its instances are weakly but not totally ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often this is subjective. Even when defining order comparison operators facilitates more compact code, the effect of those comparisons may be less clear than if an explicit key selector function were used. With the order comparison operators defined, the code that uses them is smaller, faster to read, and less likely to contain a bug. But if the relationships are not intuitive, this may make the whole system harder to reason about. If the operators are implemented only for convenience, and are not part of what it *means* conceptually to be an instance of the type that provides them, then the single responsibility principle has been violated, and the system may be harder to maintain and test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In making these design decisions, two closely releated quesions to ask are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does defining order comparison operators make it so that the code that is easy and natural to write is correct code (so that correctness is easier to achieve and maintain)? Or are there foreseeable situations where the presence of those operators would lead to confusion and subtly wrong code?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Does defining order comparison operators make it so that other functionality just works, using facilities of the language? Or does it, instead, cause things that used to be errors to *look* reasonable while still, really, being errors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Really, these are the questions to ask when deciding whether to supply custom behavior for *any* operator."
