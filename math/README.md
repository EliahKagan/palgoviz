# Math

This `math` directory contains a handful of notebooks and images that focus on
math concepts and neither use other files in the project nor rely on them for
context.

Note that there are some strongly math-related files in `palgoviz` and
`notebooks`, of which `notebooks/linalg.ipynb` is one example.

For more details on this project, see the [top-level readme](../README.md).
