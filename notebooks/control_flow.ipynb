Another is to write a recursive function with no base case; then `RecursionError` will be raised when excessive depth is reached. (There are other ways, too.) Make a top-level call.

    "Suppose you have a wrapping decorator you could apply to a recursive function definition. You’re writing a recursive function definition, and you *would* decorate it with that decorator... but you only *want* top-level calls to call the wrapper. That is, on this function, for recursive calls, you *want* the wrong claim presented in question 2 to be true! Show how this can be done, by doing it. Use a wrapping decorator that already exists (you will probably want to use the one you wrote for question 8). Write a new `def` statement to create your recursive function. Achieve the goal in a way that does not involve writing any other `def` statements, does not involve `lambda` or `class` or library facilities, and is very simple and clear. Make sure to write code showing that only top-level calls invoke the wrapper."

    "One key insight was understanding how decorators behave with respect to the name of a decorated function. When decorating a function, the name is bound to the function returned by the decorator. Thus, when called recursively, the recursive calls will act with the decorated behavior. This is similar to calling the decorator manually and re-assigning the result to the original name, as we do in the in statement `count_tree_nodes = peek_return(count_tree_nodes)`. This produces an effect similar to decorating the original definition. In question 10 under “Decorators review,” we notably *don't* do this for the `weird_countdown` function, and thus only the first call is wrapped by the wrapping decorator `reports`.\n",

    "Another key insight was that control is immediately transferred to the `finally` block before going to the intended destination from a `try` block, including upon an exception. This made it safe to write `return count_tree_nodes(root)` in the `try` block rather than storing the return value."
