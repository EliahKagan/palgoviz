Instances of built-in sequences types like `list` and `tuple`, and built-in set types like `set` and `frozenset`, hold state in their elements. Instances of built-in mapping types like `dict` hold state in their keys and values."

For example, if a variable always refers to an instance of `NoneType`, then it is guaranteed to refer to `None`, the only instance of that type. This system contains zero bits of information."
