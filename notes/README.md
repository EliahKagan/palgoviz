# Notes

These are notes relating to presenting palgoviz code as exercises. Usually this
should be done by removing the implementation of some functions/classes and
presenting the task of writing them, and getting them to pass tests, as the
exercise.

Unfortunately the material in this directory is not complete. At this time,
most code in the project provides more valuable information relevant to the
production of exercises in module, function, and class docstrings, and in
occasional comments for how to “reset” implementations to be re-worked as
exercises.

For more details on this project, see the [top-level readme](../README.md).
