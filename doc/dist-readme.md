# palgoviz - Materials for Python and algorithms, with visualization

This is a project to develop approaches and materials for teaching and learning
Python together with algorithms and data structures, with a substantial
component of visualization.

**This package is not most of palgoviz.** Most users of palgoviz should clone
[the palgoviz GitHub repository](https://github.com/EliahKagan/palgoviz)
instead (that page includes instructions). You most likely will not want to
install palgoviz with pip or have it as a dependency of another project. It is
for that rather special situation that this PyPI package exists.

Because of palgovizâ€™s educational nature, its tests and Jupyter notebooks are
important in most uses. This package omits them, as well as most documentation.
Furthermore, the main use for palgoviz, as detailed further in the repository
readme, is as source of exercises (which may require modification for your use)
or of ideas for them. In that use, *installing* palgoviz is not useful at all.

It is possible that installing palgoviz as a library may gain more use cases in
the future. For now, it is a niche use and [the palgoviz GitHub
repository](https://github.com/EliahKagan/palgoviz) is the recommended way to
read about, and obtain, palgoviz.
