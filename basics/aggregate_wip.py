class EquetrisGame:
    """
    A game of Equetris.

    In Equetris, grizzly bears hurl tetromino-shaped blocks of dynamite down a
    buckwheat silo. Telekinetic humans rotate the falling blocks by thinking
    hard about geometry. As layers at the bottom of the silo are fully filled
    in, those layers explode, clearing them and making room for more dynamite.

    Gerald and Heather claim to have played Equetris in their "glory days." It
    came up when Cassidy wondered aloud how many times they had played the same
    kickball game. "Did you know," Heather said, "that nothing is ever true
    about a game of Equetris while, at the same time, being false about that
    same game of Equetris? It's refreshing."

    Alice said she couldn't believe it. What if the same people played, at the
    same silo, with the same bears, who threw the same blocks fell in the same
    order? What if the people thought all the same thoughts, so the blocks
    always rotated in the same ways? "If you copy an Equetris game," Heather
    said, "you have a different game of Equetris. They have the same state, but
    they are certainly not equal."

    This class is a simplified model of Equetris, holding just sets of humans
    and bears. These are sets in the abstract sense (see collections.abc).
