# Major Python topics not currently covered

This is a list of some major Python topics not, or not yet, covered in this project:

- Data classes (including `attrs`) and named tuples
- Type annotations and static type checking
- `pytest` tests (rather than just as a test runner for other tests)
- `dict` subclasses in `collections`
- NumPy
- Requests

Note: The value in this list is its brevity. To prevent it from growing without
bound, only topics that a *large fraction* of Python programmers rely on and
use regularly, and that are not even introduced or summarized in this project,
should be added. (They should typically be things *most* Python programmers
rely on *daily*, and that currently have *zero coverage* in the project.)
