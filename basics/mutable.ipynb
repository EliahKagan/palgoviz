Calling `id` on an object returns an integer that represents the object's identity: an object's `id` never changes, and is never equal to the `id` of any other object that exists at the same time. (Objects whose lifetimes do not overlap can have the same `id`.) As an implementation detail of CPython, `id` returns the address of the object. "

    "\n",
    "The `==` operator checks if objects are equal. The default behavior of `==` is that objects are only equal to themselves. That is, when you write a class, if you don't provide custom equality comparison behavior by overriding `__eq__`, and you don't inherit from a class that does, then your object is equal only to itself and not equal to any other object. This is a reasonable default--the only resaonable default--since without custom `__eq__` logic, there is no way for a Python implementation to know if two different objects represent the same thing."

Such a design is questionable, but not necessarily a bug. We may know it is not useful to compare the instances for equality, or that it is a poor use of developer resources to implement equality comparison at this time, yet judge that it is acceptable for the type to go into production. If the type is a (conceptually) private implementation detail, we may be quite justified in our beliefs about how it will be used.\n",
