Recognizing tail recursion offers insights into how some algorithms work and presents opportunities for manual optimization. In particular, **tail recursion can be converted to iteration without requiring a stack**. It's obvious that, for example, semifactorials can be computed iteratively; but in less straightforward situations, especially if some recursive calls are tail calls and others aren't, some major optimization opportunities can be hard to identify without tail recursion in mind.\n",
