## Hints for `recursion.merge_sort_adaptive`

### Hint 1

You run into Professor Run, who is running backwards in the park. Both of you fall to the ground in pain, but this happens to the Professor all the time, so he is off running again. He still sees you, of course, but he doesn't recognize you until he hears the hissing of your python. Then he turns around and runs backwards to meet you. Having gotten out of his way this time, you tell him about the problem you are working on.

Professor Run tells you that runs of equal (or similar) values can be treated either as rising runs or as falling runs, and thus won't break either kind of run if they appear within it.

"In my day," he says, "We used to classify monotone runs as increasing, nonincreasing, decreasing, and nondecreasing. How unnecessary! And of course these overlap--run roughshod over each other, if you will. Just don't worry about it!"

You're relieved to hear this. But soon you have doubts. **Was the professor correct?** Why or why not?

Of increasing, decreasing, nonincreasing, and nondecreasing runs, which kinds should you detect?

### Hint 2

You think back to the rest of your conversation with Professor Run. The conversation is behind you, yet it feels as if is happening right now.

"Why do you always run backwards when you could run forwards?" you ask.

"It started a long time ago," the Professor says, "when I was in training to be an algorist. It was in the English countryside and I was the only student with no horse. We had class the special building where they kept the horses. The dorm, they called it. I went to a horse school, you see. All my fellow students were horses."

"I didn't expect this to do in that direction," you admit.

"Horses only run forwards, you see. So there was something I could do that nobody else could do. I did it as often as possible. The teacher was thrilled that I ran backwards so much and would caw in delight, so loud it was heard all throughout the special building where-- The dorm. Some places, you get there much faster by running backwards."

"I see," you say, but then you notice that the Professor's nostalgia has turned to melancholy. A tear drips from his eye, soon followed by a second tear. The second tear falls to the ground before the first.

"One day, I was late to the horse dorm. The teacher had brought in crisp red apples and set one in front of each student's stall. Running backwards, I didn't see them, and I knocked them all down as I rushed in. 'You're out of order!' the teacher cawed."

The Professor is distraught. "Good bye, good luck with your problem," mutters. He sprints away backwards. You see a this tear fall from his eye, this one somehow managing to hit the ground before the first two had.
