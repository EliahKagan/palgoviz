          # tests-compatible-poetry.yml, where the former uses uses frozen
          # poetry.lock package versions and latter doesn't, neither this nor
          # the other conda workflow (tests-compatible-conda.yml) use frozen
          # package versions. So having it in both of these would always test
          # exactly the same configuration and behavior.
